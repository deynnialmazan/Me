# About me

Hi everyone! My name is Deynni Almazan, I'm from Honduras but now living in Canada. 
I am an Industrial Engineer with work experience in Quality System Management based on ISO Standards. 
Currently, I'm a student of Software Developer Program at MITT, Winnipeg, Canada. A big change but an amazing new goal. I'm learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub, C+, Node.js and others.
