## Hello everyone! 

My name is Deynni Almazan, I'm from Honduras but now 
living in Winnipeg, Canada. 

I am passionate about technology,  a fast learner, and a problem-solver. I have always wanted to be
part of the tech world. Currently, I am student of Software Development Program at MITT in Winnipeg.
I enjoy building useful and well-designed webpages and other interesting apps. 

As a previos background, I am an Industrial Engineer & Logistical Management Engineer with high experience 
in Quality Systems Management. My work experience includes working with different teams across 
the company as the leader of the implementation and control of the Quality System.  My main roles include 
project management and process improvement.

I enjoy to keep constantly learning something new. My plan is to continue getting new tech knowledge 
and updating my current skills for building new and challenging projects.

I am so excited to showcase my skills learned so far!
