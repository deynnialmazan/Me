## Hello everyone! 

My name is Deynni Almazan, I'm from Honduras but now 
living in Winnipeg, Canada. 

I am passionate about technology,  a fast learner, and a problem-solver. I have always wanted to be
part of the tech world. Currently, I am student of Software Development Program at MITT in Winnipeg.
I'm learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub, C#, MySQL, and others. Implementing my skills 
learned so far for building useful and well-designed webpages and other interesting apps is really 
satisfactory. 

As a previos background, I am an Industrial Engineer & Logistical Management Engineer with high experience 
in Quality Systems Management. My work experience includes working with different teams across 
the company as the leader of the implementation and control of the Quality System. 
My main roles include project management, process improvement, developing internal/external audits, 
corrective and preventive actions (CAPA process), and control of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

I enjoy to keep constantly learning something new. My plan is to continue getting new tech knowledge 
and updating my current skills for building new and challenging projects. Currently, I am almost finishing 
my Software Development Program and I am looking for an internship or b opportunity.

I am so excited to showcase my skills learned so far!
